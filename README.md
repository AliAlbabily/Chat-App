## About the application
The system consists of two parts, a client and a server. The server is a type of shared connection that enables clients to communicate with each 
other by connecting to the server's IP-adress and Port. The client is the actual chat window that the user can interact with.
Through the chat, the user can send messages, attach pictures and add various users to a contact list.
